		<h2>The Concept</h2>
		<span style="width:350px">
			<h4 align="left">
				We're at war. It's the U.S. Government and its secret agencies and programs versus the State sponsored attackers versus the corporations versus the underground hackers, and the American people are caught right in the middle. Or are they responsible? They vote at the polls, with their dollars, and with their attention to keep all these forces in power and maintain the status quo.</br></br>

				Cyber warfare is being waged, and no one knows whether it's their job to stop it or to win it.</br></br>

				Each beer is a character somehow entwined in this singular thread of a story, and they all have their different perspectives of what's going on.</br></br></br></br></br>

						<h4 align="left">"The tinfoil hat loonies were right all along"</br></br>

						For many years, I thought that to get placed under surveillance, you had to be pretty reckless about sticking your neck out. For many years, that was true. Physical wiretaps, secret bugs, long-lens cameras and undercover operatives were the state of the art, and they were expensive. It was easy to make the argument that if you weren’t a troublemaker, you’d be okay.</br></br>

						In those days, people who thought the government was monitoring them were routinely dismissed as paranoid conspiracy theorists. I used to think so myself. I thought they were the lunatics on the fringe. If you went to extremes to escape government surveillance without actually being a high-level diplomat, a top executive, criminal, terrorist, or spy, I’d think you were crazy.</br></br>

						In those days, this harsh judgement may have been right, but it is now 2015, and on surveillance, the tinfoil hat brigade has been vindicated.

						<h3 align="left">Surveillance Van Pale Ale</h3>
						<h4 align="left">Turn on any cop show, and the surveillance always seems pretty straightforward. There are always a couple of guys in a van and maybe another two in a car outside some apartment building. But the truth is, real surveillance is much more subtle.</br></br>

						"How do you know they're watching us?" </br>

						<h3 align="left">Big Brother Porter</h3>
						<h4 align="left">For a while, every time I borrowed a book from my local library in Washington, D.C., I was greeted by an Orwellian poster: “Big Brother Is Watching You!” I often wondered if others paused to reflect on the implication of these words, if they understood how profoundly living under surveillance distorts a society. It transforms your perspective, your manners, your relationships with friends, colleagues, students, with every waiter and cabdriver you meet. It changes your relationship with yourself.

						<h3 align="left">Dark Agent Stout</h3>
						<h4 align="left">Black suit. White shirt. Black tie. Sinister Shades. Ominous and overbearing manner. Speaking in code. No indication of emotions or a personality. Ostensibly some kind of covert operative, but very conspicuous. They are simultaneously imposing and nondescript, which fits their mission perfectly.</br></br>

						If he has a name, expect it to be an obvious pseudonym, one of the most common Anglo-Saxon names, such as "Mr. Smith", "Mr. Jones", "Mr. Brown", etc., or else he'll be Mister Strangenoun.</br></br>

						Generally, they are in the business of keeping secrets. Laser-Guided Amnesia is a pretty common tool in their arsenal, but maybe they'll just bully you into keeping your mouth shut. Or just make you disappear. Less often, they'll make An Offer You Can't Refuse.</br></br>

						Conspiracy Theorists live in fear of the Dark Agent. They know too much.
