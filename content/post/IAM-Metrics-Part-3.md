***It can be difficult to know what to measure at which stage of your IAM implementation.***

[In Part 1 we talked about some IAM metrics you can use to measure Deployment Success and Risk Reduction](http://mattkopecki.com/post/iam-metrics/) and [in Part 2 we talked about IAM metrics you can use to measure performance.](http://mattkopecki.com/post/iam-metrics-part-2/)
It makes a lot of sense to start there because it's easy to see how IAM is providing tangible benefits to your organization even before it's mature enough to noticeably affect your team's day-to-day operations.

Pretty shortly thereafter, though, the IAM system *will* start improving day-to-day operations. This is a crucial benefit of an IAM system, and these performance improvements were probably some of the main selling points of your recent IAM modernization projects. If they were, it's especially important that you circle back, measure, and report on the improvement in these areas.

In case you haven't yet been too specific before about what operation improvements your organization could expect to see from an IAM system, now is a great time to get more specific by using the metrics listed below.

#### How To Execute

**"Shifting Left" With Password Management**

Shifting left means moving reducing administrative workload by educating or enabling users to easily execute an action that previously was centrally managed at a large cost. (it is so-named because in a left-to-right flowchart of the sequence of actions, the responsibility moves back to the left and shortens or simplifies the process).

For example, any time you can prevent the help desk from answering the same questions over and over again or completing simple transactions that customers could handle by themselves, that is shifting left.

  - Demonstrate the effectiveness of a password management deployment:
    + Redirecting password resets from service desk to automated tool
    + Reducing total number of events through SSO and password synchronization



**"Shifting Up" With Role Management**

If shifting left meant moving upstream in the same general process, shifting up means moving from one process to a newer one.

  -  Direct versus indirect access assignment:
    + Measures effectiveness of roles
  -  Policy-driven versus request-based access assignment:
    + Measures effectiveness of policies to reduce number of request transactions



  - _Entitlement requests vs. policybased assignments (time saving!)_




### A Metric
What should you measure
How should you prioritize when to measure those things
Technically, Where does that data come from (where and how - _input)_
What is the buinsess balue of that metric (why)
Tactically, how do you use that business value
