	<h1>personal finance</h1>

	<h2>philosophy</h2>
	<h3>
		Motivation - "the hook":

   * Paint a picture of the destination
   * Emotional appeal
      * the spectrum of financial security: http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/06/meet-mr-money-mustache/

   * Show why money is even more useful when you dont spend it
      * http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/26/why-hardcore-saving-is-much-more-powerful-than-masterful-investing/
      * http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/30/your-money-can-work-harder-than-you-can/

   Logical appeal with real world examples
      * http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/08/01/a-millionaire-is-made-ten-bucks-at-a-time/
      * http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/

Reality check:

   * What to expect, and quality of life considerations
      * This isn't about taking it to the extreme, where you save so much that you struggle to keep food on the table and to keep the water from leaking through our roofs.

http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/20/yeah-mr-money-mustache-good-for-you-but-what-about-real-people/
      * early retirement? maybe. depends on the lifestyle you want to attain. at million, you can retire right away and give yourself 40k per year for the rest of your life. but if you want to live in an area with 15k per year of property taxes, that lifestyle probably won't feel like retirement.
   * Who is this for
      * Who is this blog for? It's for people that have the earning potential to be millionaires one day. Who is that? If you take home $40,000 per year and save half of it, it could be you in 50 years. There are a lot of people out there that save even more than that too. But this blog probably isn't for you. To become a millionaire that way, you probably have to make some serious cutbacks. But if you're a young professional that takes home $70k, $100k, or more, then the picture starts to look a little different.
      * Engineers, doctors, lawyers, bankers, consultants, entrepreneurs. The younger the better, so you've had less time to make costly financial mistakes and have more time to save.
      * How to make your spouse love frugality


      * I was fortunate enough to be born into a great family, who had the means to provide me with a fabulous education and surround me by some of the most interesting and successful people in the world.


   * Minimum Viable definition and MVM strategy
      * definition of MVP


      * Frugality is the New Fanciness. once you get going, it's almost addictive. it's more fun to watch that number on the bank account go up and up and up than it is to have the newest gadget.
      * we're not talking about fake luxury. no Folexes, no cheap cars with glass packs on the back. we're talking about the best stuff here. but we're avoiding excess. thinking ahead, buying the best when it's necessary and skipping the crap.
      * Getting rich is more mental than it is tactical
      * some people try to live the "cheap as fuck" lifestyle but feel like it's just not in their DNA. I live cheap, but not ‘cheap as fuck’. I eat out when I feel like it, I buy what I need when I need it and I am very very happy. I’m just SMART about spending money. Being smart about spending money is not being ‘cheap as fuck’, but it has a similar effect.
      * once you see how rich you could be, it will kick you over the edge.
      * spend much less money than they earn, for several years.
      * you can always have that mindset with you. yea he has an iphone 5, but when my iphone 4 cam out 2 years ago it was 2 years ahead of the competition. and you know what? even though there are two better phones out there now (the 4S and the 5), I just smirk and keep walking because I know I'm not missing anything and I am winning the bank account game
      * maximizing output, minimizing expenditures. not mutually exclusive, like a lot of philosophies
      * it will be an adjustment
