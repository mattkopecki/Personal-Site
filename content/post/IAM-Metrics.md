Category: coverage --> deployment success, but also tied to risk reduction. Maybe link to KRIs, and link to other performance indicators
* Account and Repository Coverage
  - These are simple metrics:
    + Account repository coverage
    + Total account coverage
  - Some advantage in categorizing account repositories:
    + Sensitivity (e.g., regulatory significance, risk, supply chain)
    + Applications versus infrastructure
  - Highlight growth in repositories
* Authentication Coverage
  - Authentication methods allocated to endpoints:
    + User experience advantages for integration
    + Risk reduction with some authentication types
    + Mobile and multifactor authentication could be factored in
  - Some advantage in categorizing authentication endpoints
* Privileged Access Management Coverage
  - Prioritization of coverage based on account types:
    + Shared accounts with high privileges (system, operational) present highest risks usually
  - May be opportunities for further granularity:
    + Service accounts
    + Application-to-application accounts
