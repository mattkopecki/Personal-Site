**Power Laws**

- 1. reminder, even though a lot of what happens around us from a day to day perspective doesn't operate based on power laws, in cybersecurity we operate in a universe that's governed by them.
  2. knowing that we're in a power law world, how do you defend?
- Ask yourself how do we know that “average/mean cost per record or number of vulnerabilities or whatever” is a good summary statistic
- Measure things in quintiles and think about each quintile
- Rethink how to communicate and visualize uncertainty - good examples in paper “when-ish is my bus”
- Risk matrix with low medium high actually adds risk (there is research for this) so it’s dangerous
- Risk management matrix avoidance acceptance mitigation transfer
