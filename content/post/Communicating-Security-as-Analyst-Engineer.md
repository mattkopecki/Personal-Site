Analyst 
- Communicate to your boss the same way they communicate to their boss - in terms of risk and benefit to the organization. Easy to do at the task level - if I do this, there is a risk that that won’t get done. Pretty soon it’ll be second nature and you will describe other things in those terms
- present findings or recommendations bottom line up front. Often literally. There’s always more detail, background, or info, and it probably is really critical to know. But it’s all in support of the bottom line, so that can’t get lost.
How to say it (like Manager Tools does)
- food for thought vs. arguments. Don’t just throw things out there for people to chew on, assemble the relevant facts into an argument and continue building in support of that one argument
