Security is not a Checklist
With that said, here are checklists that should be followed because you need to get this stuff done and out of the way first so that you can focus on the hard stuff

I am in favor of checklists for certain critical tasks, even if they are repetitive and/or boring. They are helpful in making medicine safer.
