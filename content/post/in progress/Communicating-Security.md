**Communicating Security: as an Analyst or Engineer**
- Communicate to your boss the same way they communicate to their boss - in terms of risk and benefit to the organization. Easy to do at the task level - if I do this, there is a risk that that won’t get done. Pretty soon it’ll be second nature and you will describe other things in those terms
- present findings or recommendations bottom line up front. Often literally. There’s always more detail, background, or info, and it probably is really critical to know. But it’s all in support of the bottom line, so that can’t get lost.
How to say it (like Manager Tools does)
- food for thought vs. arguments. Don’t just throw things out there for people to chew on, assemble the relevant facts into an argument and continue building in support of that one argument


How to communicate security if you're a technical person
- how to tie to business risk
- how to tie to business value, return on investment

**Communicating Security: as a Manager**

- Advocate for best practices, abdicate on details
- the directory should stay a directory. If a consumer needs different data, transform elsewhere
- sources of truth should be respected instead of subverted
- offer standardized services and help consumers conform, don’t customize one off to accommodate
- to build organizational influence, build integrations
- are you a CTO, CISO, or CIO at heart?
- you’re still a manager of people at core
- figure out where the technical risks lies and ask for/plan for POCs

**Communicating Security: to Executives**



**Communicating Security: to Users**

UI/UX - how do we make sure security is part of the user experience?

change the terms - privacy, security, etc. mean different things to end users

change the context - security isnt negative
