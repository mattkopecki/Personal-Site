* Effectiveness metrics:
  - Active identities with missing/multiple source records
  - Contractors/B2B accounts with invalid expiration date
  - Identities with invalid supervisor
  - B2B accounts with invalid business partner
  - B2B accounts with invalid sponsor
  - Consumer identities unmatched in CRM
* Performance metrics:
  - Entitlement requests vs. policybased assignments (time saving!)
  - New identities created
  - Account/Application usage (cost!)
  - Number of applications integrated
  - Number of passwords used
  - Number of privileged/service account under management
  - Number of applications using IAM APIs
* Efficiency:
  - Number of calls to password help desk.
  - Percent of access-related transactions fulfilled via policies instead of access requests.
* Effectiveness:
  - Coverage and level of control over account repositories.
  - Administrative leverage delivered by roles.
  - Number/Severity of audit findings.
* Enablement:
  - Employee, developer and customer satisfaction survey results.
  - Ease of onboarding new customers
  - Additional reach of SSO solutions
  - New ways of doing business
* Account and Repository Coverage
  - These are simple metrics:
    + Account repository coverage
    + Total account coverage
  - Some advantage in categorizing account repositories:
    + Sensitivity (e.g., regulatory significance, risk, supply chain)
    + Applications versus infrastructure
  - Highlight growth in repositories
* Authentication Coverage
  - Authentication methods allocated to endpoints:
    + User experience advantages for integration
    + Risk reduction with some authentication types
    + Mobile and multifactor authentication could be factored in
  - Some advantage in categorizing authentication endpoints
* Privileged Access Management Coverage
  - Prioritization of coverage based on account types:
    + Shared accounts with high privileges (system, operational) present highest risks usually
  - May be opportunities for further granularity:
    + Service accounts
    + Application-to-application accounts
* "Shifting Left" With Password Management
  - Demonstrate the effectiveness of a password management deployment:
    + Redirecting password resets from service desk to automated tool
    + Reducing total number of events through SSO and password synchronization
* "Shifting Up" With Role Management
  -  Direct versus indirect access assignment:
    + Measures effectiveness of roles
  -  Policy-driven versus request-based access assignment:
    + Measures effectiveness of policies to reduce number of request transactions
* Administrative Effectiveness
  - Remediation of orphan/rogue accounts:
    + Timeliness
    + Outcomes (e.g., classification, owner assignment, removal)
  - Access certification coverage:
    + Uncertified request-based assignments
    + Uncertified privileged accounts
    + Too rapid attestations
  - Segregation of duties (SOD) risks:
    + Active SOD risks (with and without mitigating controls)
    + Timeliness of remediation (by risk level)
* B2C Interactions
  - Customer Enrollments:
    + Account creation
    + Subscriptions and profiles
    + Guest interactions
    + Social logins
  - Repeat Access:
    + Frequency of visits
    + Associated purchases
  - Cross-Selling:
    + Interest in/attraction to other offerings
  - Dormancy:
    + Registration abandonment
    + Cart abandonment
    + Accounts not accessed
    + Account expiration
    + Lost IDs and forgotten passwords
