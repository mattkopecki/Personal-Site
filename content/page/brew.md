**WE'RE AT WAR.** It's the U.S. Government and its secret agencies and programs versus the State sponsored attackers versus the corporations versus the underground hackers, and the American people are caught right in the middle.

Or are they responsible? They vote at the polls, with their dollars, and with their attention to keep all these forces in power and maintain the status quo.

Cyber warfare is being waged, should we try to stop it, or to win it?

### ABOUT

**Bad government agencies, good beer.**

Tinfoil Hat Brewery is an undercover operation based somewhere in Chicago. Our beer was first weaponized and perfected in 2015 under the assumption that no one was watching. Soon after, an unknown attack vector was exploited by a nation-state actor, and within hours Tinfoil Hat knockoffs became the best selling beers in China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

Now no amount of feigned public outrage and hyperbolic mouth-frothing can stand in our way. Drink our beer and become a co-conspirator! 


### THE BREWER

Snowden had his NSA docs. Assange had his leaks. **Matt Kopecki has his beer.** [Get in contact!](http://tinfoilhatbrewery.com/contact)
