						<h3>"The tinfoil hat loonies were right all along"

For many years, I thought that to get placed under surveillance, you had to be pretty reckless about sticking your neck out. For many years, that was true. Physical wiretaps, secret bugs, long-lens cameras and undercover operatives were the state of the art, and they were expensive. It was easy to make the argument that if you weren’t a troublemaker, you’d be okay.

In those days, people who thought the government was monitoring them were routinely dismissed as paranoid conspiracy theorists. I used to think so myself. I thought they were the lunatics on the fringe. If you went to extremes to escape government surveillance without actually being a high-level diplomat, a top executive, criminal, terrorist, or spy, I’d think you were crazy.

In those days, this harsh judgement may have been right, but it is now 2015, and on surveillance, the tinfoil hat brigade has been vindicated.</h3><a href="http://mattkopecki.com/brew"> Keep Reading...</a>

						<h2>Big Brother Porter</h2>
						<h3>For a while, every time I borrowed a book from my local library in Washington, D.C., I was greeted by an Orwellian poster: “Big Brother Is Watching You!” I often wondered if others paused to reflect on the implication of these words, if they understood how profoundly living under surveillance distorts a society. It transforms your perspective, your manners, your relationships with friends, colleagues, students, with every waiter and cabdriver you meet. It changes your relationship with yourself.</h3><a href="http://mattkopecki.com/brew"> Keep Reading...</a>
