**WE'RE AT WAR.** It's the U.S. Government and its secret agencies and programs versus the State sponsored attackers versus the corporations versus the underground hackers, and the American people are caught right in the middle.

Or are they responsible? They vote at the polls, with their dollars, and with their attention to keep all these forces in power and maintain the status quo.

Cyber warfare is being waged, should we try to stop it, or to win it?
