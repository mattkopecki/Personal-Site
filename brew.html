						<h4 align="left">"The tinfoil hat loonies were right all along"</br></br>

						You used to have to be pretty reckless about sticking your neck out to get placed under surveillance. Physical wiretaps, secret bugs, long-lens cameras and undercover operatives were the state of the art, and they were expensive. It was easy to make the argument that if you weren’t a troublemaker, you’d be okay.</br></br>

						In those days, people who thought the government was monitoring them were routinely dismissed as paranoid conspiracy theorists. If you went to extremes to escape government surveillance without actually being a high-level diplomat, a top executive, criminal, terrorist, or spy, you’d be crazy.</br></br>

						In those days, this harsh judgement may have been right, but it's now 2016, and on surveillance, the tinfoil hat brigade has been vindicated.

						<h4 align="left">"That pool cleaner's van has been parked out on the street for over four hours. No one's pool is that dirty."</br></br>

						Turn on any cop show, and the surveillance always seems pretty straightforward. There are always a couple of guys in a van and maybe another two in a car outside some apartment building. But the truth is, real surveillance is much more subtle.

						<h4 align="left">For a while, every time I borrowed a book from my local library in Washington, D.C., I was greeted by an Orwellian poster: “Big Brother Is Watching You!” I often wondered if others paused to reflect on the implication of these words, if they understood how profoundly living under surveillance distorts a society. It transforms your perspective, your manners, your relationships with friends, colleagues, students, with every waiter and cabdriver you meet. It changes your relationship with yourself.

				<b>Bad government agencies, good beer.</b> </br></br>

				Tinfoil Hat Brewery is an undercover operation based somewhere in Chicago. Our beer was first weaponized and perfected in 2015 under the assumption that no one was watching. Soon after, an unknown attack vector was exploited by a nation-state actor, and within hours Tinfoil Hat knockoffs became the best selling beers in China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.</br></br>

				Now no amount of feigned public outrage and hyperbolic mouth-frothing can stand in our way. Drink our beer and become a co-conspirator! </br></br>

				END TRANSMISSION.
