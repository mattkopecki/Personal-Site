**Data Privacy as a business enabler**
The environment of mistrust will present opportunities for companies that can show genuine concern for protecting data and that they have proper security infrastructure in place. In other words, earned trust becomes an asset when consumers and other organizations are willing to do business with you because they feel secure doing so

**Cyber-xyz is the new goon job**
The goon category is interesting in a future world where AI has replaced most jobs, because it can employ an unlimited number of people. (Goon jobs exist to counterbalance other goon jobs. Militaries are the canonical example.)
Most jobs -- teachers, auto workers, plumbers, farmers -- have a natural ceiling on employment related to demand, but goon jobs don't because when one side hires more goons, the other side has to also. Militaries have created millions of jobs this way.
Goon jobs are not just blue-collar. A growing category of goon that allows unlimited highly paid professional job creation is inter-governmental lawyers. For example, the CA government is suing the EPA about vehicle emissions limits. Both sides can justify a big budget for hiring lawyers. Metropolitan areas like the Bay Area provide lots of opportunities for cities to sue each other, transit authorities, and the state. I don't see any upper limit to the number of jobs this can create.
All this is only a bad thing if you care about efficiency. If you let go of that axiom, there are unlimited jobs to be created.

**Guillermo talk - Intersection of identity management and appsec for OWASP in August or September**
  - provide components and services to development teams to make them more successful. For them Identity is annoying, for you it’s a source of risk
  - Both idm and appsec have similar goals of reducing vulnerabilities etc. but merely stating that and having them operate alongside isn’t helpful. How can idm enable appsec and vice versa.
  - SANS Institute report for a moment, we find that respondents listed their top three challenges to implementing application security in their organizations:
  - 33 percent pointed to silos between security, development and business units, making it hard to establish ultimate responsibility and preventing effective collaboration
  - 37 percent bemoaned the lack of funding and management buy-in
  - 38 percent reported a lack of application security skills, tools and methods
  - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6k1MmroFQx0
      - 77% of breaches were identity related
  - Compare how idm attempts to stop intruders vs how appsec does
  - Take the OWASP top 10 and rephrase with users in the mix to show “so what”
  - OWASP number 2 is about breaking authentication to assume user identities


**Blog topic - IoT is nothing new, it’s just security concerns inherent to implementing a technology in your env that is insecure and not tested or understood - see ESW 94 at an hour in**
  - versus, azure sphere


**Blog topics - Masha Sedova's interview in BSW 88 - Shaping Security Culture**
- Shaping security culture, how we build awareness
- Why build security culture?
- humans are the weakest link, shouldnt we always be investing most heavily in technology? someone is always going to click, so what's the point?
  - that is a solution, but if you don't have thoughtful employees who are educated and empowered, you arent fighting back with everything you have
  - of course your emloyees are not going to be your perfect solution, but neither is your technology stack
  - the comanies that are leading the way in terms of full stack security and defense are really thinking about empowering their employees
- what does it mean to empower your employees?
- it's answering the question of how do i have a thoughtful security culture? how do I make sure my employees have secutity top of mind and embedded in the work they do? how do i make sure we dont aggregate security debt and mistakes as we build out architecture and continue to make the tradeoff between do we go faster and do we become less risky? how do we as an organization know where that tradeoff is between risk and growth?
- people who do securty for a living have the opportunity to understand that risks are out there and they understand how real and relevant and prevalent they are in the organization and across the business network. but if you work in industry or anywhere where the majority of the company isnt security professionals, then the majority of your employees and executives arent getting exposed to what it means to have an appropriate threat register
- the executives and orgs that get securty the most are those that have had the 'opportunity' to go through a major security incident or breach under their watch, where they understood the impact of not investing in security and they were able to take that into consideration for their new future. for orgs that dont have employees that have experience like that, that's where security teams can share their knowledge and expertise in thoughtful ways.
  - simulations that give people the pain of having to react to an incident without actually having to go through a breach (red team attacks, tabletop simulations, virtual game experiences where people have to consider what it would be like to react to an incident). essentially give people the perspective of this is a real threat, it does apply to my job, and i have to consider this in addition to all the other things that relate to my job
- how do we get orgs there without having them experiance a breach? what are ongoing things we can do to allow people to come over to the security culture side?
- where do we want to go
- when I say security culture, i probably have a different picture in my mind then when you say security culture, or when the head of a large bank says security culture
- competing securty culture framework
  - X axis: internal focus, external focus
  - Y: tight control, loose control
  - ex: company with tight control and internal focus is really focused on process. their big north star around security culture is enforcing policy. government, military. everyone follows the rules
  - ex. tight control, external focus, youre focused on passing audits. financial, insurance companies. checkboxes all get met on time and within expectation. everyone knows what theyre respinsible for and they make sure they deliver it on time so when an external auditor comes in it's totally done.
  - ex. loos control, internal focus. empoering people. how do we get people to communicate, participate, involve. positive motivation and engagement. if you dont work at an org that says we're going to fire you if you dont follow the policy like the government, then empowering people is one of your best options.
    - this means youre giving people kudos and applause whenever they do the correct thing. you have opportunities to recognize leadership when parts of your business are going above and beyond and shipping secure products or creating new and thoughtful secure processes.
  - ex. loose control, external focus. basically get results no matter what. more common early stage startups, smaller tech companies for example. companies that value stability, agility, innovation. dont tell me how to do it, just get it done.
- so when we say security culture, there's not one culture that fits everyone. 
- if i were in the shoes of a CISO either thinking about this for the first time or rethinking about shapiong my culture, i need to think about what are my cardinal directions. you cant just say get results if you work for , say, a large insurance company who said i appreciate that you have a fantastic drop in clickthrough rates, but your patching isnt anywhere near where our audit requirements say they need to be. so you need to figure out who you have to please, what is your culture currently, and whatdoes the gap look like between where you are and where you need to go.
- it may be you need training, but maybe you need more thoughtful incentives that recognize and value the correct behavior, however you define correct behavior for your organization
  - do i ship on time and insecurely or do i ship it late and securely. if i dont understand the impact of shipping insecure code, and i get rewarded for shipping on time, then i'm going to continuouly make that decision around shipping code insecurely
  - over time, youre going to be aggregating less security debt and exposure, even if the individual employees at a micro level dont think about that that's what theyre doing. 
- in the early days, compliance was one of the biggest drivers of security. now we see it coming from multiple other directions. how do you figure out how to balance risk and reward now if youre not regulated?
- what does it mean to have a security culture that isnt compliance driven
- it's how do we get every person to hgave a sense of responsibility
  - running the right tests, using automation, having a relationship with the people who make and test securioty requirements
- to get someone to do something, you need to either get people to care (altruistic, or incentive driven) or you need to make it easier (tools, automation)
  - security without friction gets more security adoption
- masha's company elevate - focused on 3 things
- getting people to care - changing their mindest around secuoity
- giving them the tools to make certain behaviors really easy
  - phising, reporting suspicious activity, detecting malware, adopting 2fa
- measuring 
  - leaderboards, metrics, who is a security culture leader and who is on the bottom of the bell curve
- this is a full time job and CISOs dont have time for it with everyuthing else they have going on, need to have someone who focuses on this and champions it.


**saying: brakes exist in a car for it to go faster. we have to figure out for security as business leaders, what is that perfect pivot for going as fast as we can without compromisig the safety of our organization**
  - look at racing as analogy


**how did we get to a point where security is different from quality**
- describe the problem. describe why they shouldnt be separate. don't use the words DevSecOps, but talk about how security bugs should break the build just like other bugs. talk about security requirements, and how they actually need to be stated.
- could be interesting to dig into some history and try to actually formulate a story of why security ended up being different from quality
    - security as always been at the end of the waterfall. what hasnt happened is making security part of the development process. security shouldnt be standalone, integrate it into the business 
    - need to run through unit tests and make sure the behavior of the app is correct, and this should include security as well as any other class of bug
    - hard to check for business logic flaws, the Rapid 7 guys talked about this too how they need a human tester in addition to a scanner


**Power Laws**
  - Ask yourself how do we know that “average/mean cost per record or number of vulnerabilities or whatever” is a good summary statistic
  - Measure things in quintiles and think about each quintile
  - Rethink how to communicate and visualize uncertainty - good examples in paper “when-ish is my bus”
  - Risk matrix with low medium high actually adds risk (there is research for this) so it’s dangerous
  - Risk management matrix avoidance acceptance mitigation transfer
