As a manager
- Advocate for best practices, abdicate on details
- the directory should stay a directory. If a consumer needs different data, transform elsewhere
- sources of truth should be respected instead of subverted
- offer standardized services and help consumers conform, don’t customize one off to accommodate
- to build organizational influence, build integrations
- are you a CTO, CISO, or CIO at heart?
- you’re still a manager of people at core
- figure out where the technical risks lies and ask for/plan for POCs
