**leaders sometimes don't understand what they're truly trading off.**

Yeah, it might keep you up at night sometimes. You know your security posture isn't what it should be. But look around us...look at Target or The Home Depot. There was an impact on the stock but then a recovery. They paid some fines and had some other things to do, but from a stock- and future-of-the-company perspective, they've fully recovered after those breaches. Our data's still in Equifax even though they got breached.

Can you justify the expense to lock it down when the penalty is not that high?

Stock prices might go back up. But what are the other impacts to the organization that business leaders may not be considering? What are potential brand and trust losses that they may be facing, and how do you measure that? At what point is it worth investing some amount of money, but knowing that a breach may still be possible?

- what does the true cost of a breach look like
- one of the biggest costs of a breach is how much it interrupts the work of the company because of how many hands are on deck to recover from that.
  - sales department is now trained to answer customer objections. and yes your deals might still close but how much of that gets delayed. bad quarter?
  - there's also significant cost in loss of morale in employees. and it's going to take a long time to measure, but how hard is your recruiting after that? how many people have left in the 6 months that it might take them to find a job after that.
  - more broadly, running a business as interrupt-driven is highly ineffective and highly disruptive to creating stability.
  - Interrupt driven doesn’t just apply to breaches
  - If security isn’t early in your process, you’re always going to be backing up. How much wasted dev and test time (not to mention schedule delays) vs paying a security engineer 100k
  - Even if you’re mature and have a bug bounty, compare the 25 emails and month it takes to evaluate if the bug is real, what’s the impact, and close a bug at that stage versus the day it would take to fix if discovered internally and by someone who was already in all the meetings and understood the context and potential impact . The payout for the bug itself is nearly irrelevant
